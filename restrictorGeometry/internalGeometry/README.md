These STL files can be used to generate the CFD mesh for a 2mm, 3mm or 4mm restrictor with 2-way splitter.

## 2mm restrictor and 2-way splitter

- inlet.stl
- outlet_ur.stl
- outlet_wr.stl
- walls-2mm.stl

## 3mm restrictor and 2-way splitter

- inlet.stl
- outlet_ur.stl
- outlet_wr.stl
- walls-3mm.stl

## 4mm restrictor and 2-way splitter

- inlet.stl
- outlet_ur.stl
- outlet_wr.stl
- walls-4mm.stl

## 2-way splitter with no restrictions

- inlet.stl
- outlet_ur.stl
- outlet_ur2-noR.stl
- walls-noR.stl
